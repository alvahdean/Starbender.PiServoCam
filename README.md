Web UI for Raspberry Pi Camera and PanTiltHat

This is somewhat enhanced version of the UI that the PanTiltHat implements. It's original purpose was to monitor my remote astronomy observatory but also a practical sandbox for me to ramp up my severly lacking UI skills. If you find it useful, feel free to use any or all of it per the associated and very liberal MIT license.
